# Stage 1 : novice
- learn context-free features meaning isolate learning parts
- isolated knowledge will add up and will create compound effect
- eg. learning second language starting with learning phonetic rules without
  knowning the meaning of words or chess player knowing the value of each piece
on board or novice pilot knowing how to read cockpit instruments.

# Stage 2 : competence
- this stage achieved by adding concerete experience to first stage

  sounds means when used in the right situations or chess player seeing some
patterns while playing them like "unbalanced pawn structure", "over-extended"

# Stage 3 : proficiency

  patterns

  patterns use novice knowledge to memorize them and recall it.
- eg. language learned know using words in sentence at rigth time and enable him
  to describe situations, ask or order something, chess player know try to use
these patterns to his advantage or see them as irrelevant.
- given principle rule with knowledge of set of patterns and incoming cues will
  help learned to decide what to do in that situation.
